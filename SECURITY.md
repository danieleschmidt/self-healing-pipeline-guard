## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in Self-Healing Pipeline Guard, please report it to us in a responsible manner.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them by emailing security@terragonlabs.com with the following information:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 24 hours.
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 72 hours.
- **Status Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress throughout the process.
- **Resolution Timeline**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days.

### Security Response Process

1. **Report Reception**: Security team receives and acknowledges the report
2. **Initial Triage**: Assess severity and impact of the vulnerability
3. **Investigation**: Reproduce and analyze the vulnerability
4. **Fix Development**: Develop and test the security fix
5. **Disclosure**: Coordinate responsible disclosure with the reporter
6. **Release**: Deploy the fix and publish security advisory

## Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization

- **API Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with configurable expiration
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular permissions for different user roles
- **OAuth Integration**: Support for GitHub, GitLab, and other OAuth providers
- **API Key Management**: Secure API key generation and rotation

### Data Protection

- **Encryption in Transit**: All communication encrypted with TLS 1.3
- **Encryption at Rest**: Sensitive data encrypted using AES-256
- **Secret Management**: Integration with HashiCorp Vault and cloud secret stores
- **Data Sanitization**: Automatic removal of sensitive data from logs

### Infrastructure Security

- **Container Security**: 
  - Non-root user execution
  - Minimal base images
  - Regular vulnerability scanning
  - Signed container images
- **Network Security**:
  - Network segmentation
  - Firewall rules
  - VPN/private network access
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive security monitoring and alerting

### Secure Development Practices

- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning with Bandit, Semgrep
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability assessment of dependencies
- **Code Review**: Mandatory security review for all changes
- **Secrets Scanning**: Automated detection of exposed secrets

### Compliance

- **SOC 2 Type II**: Security controls aligned with SOC 2 requirements
- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy compliance
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data protection compliance (when applicable)
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management alignment

## Security Configuration

### Required Security Headers

The application sets the following security headers:

```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

### Environment Variables

Security-related environment variables that should be configured:

```bash
# Required
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-jwt-secret-here

# Optional but recommended
ENABLE_HTTPS=true
SECURE_COOKIES=true
TRUSTED_HOSTS=["your-domain.com"]
CORS_ORIGINS=["https://your-domain.com"]
```

### Database Security

- Use strong, unique passwords for database connections
- Enable SSL/TLS for database connections
- Implement database connection pooling with limits
- Regular database backup encryption

### API Security Best Practices

- **Rate Limiting**: Implement appropriate rate limits for all endpoints
- **Input Validation**: Strict validation of all input parameters
- **Output Encoding**: Proper encoding of all output data
- **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages

## Security Monitoring

### Metrics to Monitor

- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual API usage patterns
- Database connection anomalies
- File system access violations
- Network connection anomalies

### Alerting Thresholds

- More than 10 failed authentication attempts per minute
- More than 100 requests per minute from a single IP
- Database connection pool > 90% utilized
- SSL certificate expiring within 30 days

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Classification

1. **Critical**: Data breach, system compromise, privilege escalation
2. **High**: Authentication bypass, sensitive data exposure
3. **Medium**: Denial of service, information disclosure
4. **Low**: Security misconfiguration, non-exploitable vulnerabilities

### Response Timeline

- **Critical**: Immediate response, resolution within 4 hours
- **High**: Response within 2 hours, resolution within 24 hours
- **Medium**: Response within 8 hours, resolution within 72 hours
- **Low**: Response within 24 hours, resolution within 1 week
