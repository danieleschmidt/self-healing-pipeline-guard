# Alerting Strategy

This document outlines the alerting strategy for the Self-Healing Pipeline Guard, including alert types, escalation procedures, and best practices.

## Alert Categories

### Critical Alerts (P0)

**Immediate response required - 24/7 paging**

- **Service Down**: Application completely unavailable
- **Database Outage**: Primary database unreachable
- **Redis Outage**: Cache layer completely down
- **High Error Rate**: Error rate > 10% for 5+ minutes
- **Security Incident**: Detected security breach or attack

**Response Time**: < 15 minutes
**Escalation**: Immediate paging to on-call engineer

### High Priority Alerts (P1)

**Response required within business hours**

- **Performance Degradation**: Response time > 2 seconds for 10+ minutes
- **Healing Failure Rate**: Healing success rate < 70% for 30+ minutes
- **Webhook Processing Delays**: Webhook queue depth > 1000
- **External API Failures**: Critical integrations failing
- **Disk Space Warning**: Disk usage > 85%

**Response Time**: < 1 hour during business hours
**Escalation**: Alert to team channel and assign to on-call

### Medium Priority Alerts (P2)

**Investigation required within 24 hours**

- **Moderate Performance Issues**: Response time > 1 second

## Escalation Procedures

### P0 - Critical Alerts

1. **Immediate Response (0-15 minutes)**
   - On-call engineer paged
   - Automated incident creation in PagerDuty
   - Slack notification to `#healing-guard-alerts`

2. **Escalation Level 1 (15-30 minutes)**
   - Team lead notified
   - Additional team members alerted
   - Incident commander assigned

3. **Escalation Level 2 (30-60 minutes)**
   - Engineering manager notified
   - Cross-team assistance requested
   - External vendor support engaged if needed

4. **Escalation Level 3 (60+ minutes)**
   - CTO/VP Engineering notified
   - Customer communication initiated
   - Post-incident review scheduled

### P1 - High Priority Alerts

1. **Business Hours Response (0-1 hour)**
   - Team notification via Slack
   - Assignment to available team member
   - Initial investigation started

2. **Escalation (1-4 hours)**
   - Team lead involvement
   - Additional resources assigned
   - Customer notification if user-facing

### P2/P3 - Medium/Low Priority Alerts

1. **Standard Response (24-72 hours)**
   - Added to team backlog
   - Assignment during sprint planning
   - Investigation and resolution during normal work hours

## Alert Fatigue Prevention

### Best Practices

1. **Meaningful Thresholds**
   - Set thresholds based on business impact
   - Use historical data to calibrate
   - Regularly review and adjust

2. **Alert Consolidation**
   - Group related alerts
   - Use alert dependencies
   - Implement flap detection

3. **Temporary Silencing**
   - During maintenance windows
   - For known issues
   - With automatic expiration

4. **Alert Quality Metrics**
   - Time to resolution
   - False positive rate
   - Alert acknowledge rate

### Alert Tuning

```python
# Example alert tuning script
def analyze_alert_quality():
    """Analyze alert quality metrics."""
    alerts = get_alerts_last_30_days()
    
    metrics = {
        'total_alerts': len(alerts),
        'acknowledged_alerts': len([a for a in alerts if a.acknowledged]),
        'false_positives': len([a for a in alerts if a.false_positive]),
        'mean_time_to_acknowledge': calculate_mtta(alerts),
        'mean_time_to_resolve': calculate_mttr(alerts)
    }
    
    # Alert if metrics indicate poor alert quality
    if metrics['false_positives'] / metrics['total_alerts'] > 0.2:
        send_alert_tuning_notification(
            "High false positive rate",
            metrics
        )
```

## Runbook Integration

### Alert Annotations

Every alert should include:
- **Summary**: Brief description of the issue
- **Description**: Detailed explanation with current values
- **Runbook URL**: Link to troubleshooting steps
- **Dashboard URL**: Link to relevant metrics
- **Priority**: P0/P1/P2/P3 classification

### Runbook Standards

```yaml
annotations:
  summary: "High response time detected"
  description: "95th percentile response time is {{ $value }}s for {{ $labels.endpoint }}"
  runbook_url: "https://docs.company.com/runbooks/high-response-time"
  dashboard_url: "https://grafana.company.com/d/healing-guard-performance"
  priority: "P1"
  impact: "Users experiencing slow responses"
  troubleshooting: |
    1. Check application logs for errors
    2. Verify database performance
    3. Check external API response times
    4. Review recent deployments
```

## Metrics for Alerting Effectiveness

### Key Performance Indicators

- **Mean Time to Acknowledge (MTTA)**: Average time to acknowledge alerts
- **Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR)**: Average time to resolve incidents
- **False Positive Rate**: Percentage of alerts that don't require action
- **Alert Volume**: Number of alerts per day/week
- **Escalation Rate**: Percentage of alerts that escalate

### Dashboard Queries

```promql
# Alert volume by severity
sum(rate(prometheus_notifications_total[1h])) by (severity)

# Time to acknowledge
histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(alertmanager_notification_latency_seconds_bucket[1h]))

# False positive rate (requires manual tagging)
rate(alerts_false_positive_total[1d]) / rate(alerts_total[1d])
```

## Testing and Validation

### Alert Testing

1. **Synthetic Monitoring**: Generate test conditions
2. **Chaos Engineering**: Intentional failure injection
3. **Alert Drills**: Regular testing of escalation procedures
4. **Runbook Validation**: Verify troubleshooting steps

### Monitoring the Monitors

- **Alertmanager Health**: Monitor alert delivery
- **Prometheus Targets**: Ensure metrics collection
- **Notification Channels**: Verify delivery mechanisms
- **Runbook Accessibility**: Ensure documentation is available
