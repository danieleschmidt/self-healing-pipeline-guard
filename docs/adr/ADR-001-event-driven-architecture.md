# ADR-001: Event-Driven Architecture for Pipeline Monitoring

## Status
**Accepted** - January 2025

## Context

The Self-Healing Pipeline Guard needs to monitor and respond to pipeline events from multiple CI/CD platforms (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, CircleCI) in real-time. The system must handle:

- High volume of pipeline events (potentially thousands per hour)
- Different webhook formats and delivery patterns from various platforms
- Asynchronous processing requirements for ML analysis
- Need for reliable event processing with retry mechanisms
- Scalability requirements as customer base grows

### Constraints
- Must integrate with existing CI/CD platforms without requiring significant changes
- Response time for failure detection should be under 30 seconds
- System must be resilient to temporary outages of external services
- Need to maintain event ordering for accurate failure analysis

## Decision

We will implement an **event-driven architecture** using the following components:

### Core Architecture
1. **Webhook Receivers**: Platform-specific endpoints that normalize incoming events
2. **Event Bus**: Redis Streams for reliable message queuing
3. **Event Processors**: Async workers that handle different event types
4. **State Store**: PostgreSQL for persistent state and Redis for caching

### Event Flow
```
CI/CD Platform → Webhook Receiver → Event Bus → Event Processor → Healing Engine
                                              ↓
                                        Dead Letter Queue
```

### Event Schema
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "platform": "github|gitlab|jenkins|circleci",
  "event_type": "pipeline.failed|pipeline.started|pipeline.completed",
  "repository": "org/repo",
  "pipeline_id": "12345",
  "job_id": "67890",
  "metadata": {
    "commit_sha": "abc123",
    "branch": "main",
    "author": "user@example.com",
    "logs_url": "https://...",
    "artifacts_url": "https://..."
  },
  "failure_context": {
    "exit_code": 1,
    "error_patterns": ["timeout", "connection_refused"],
    "duration_ms": 120000
  }
}
```

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Synchronous Request-Response
**Pros**: Simpler implementation, immediate feedback
**Cons**: Poor scalability, blocking operations, single point of failure
**Verdict**: Rejected due to scalability concerns

### 2. Database Polling
**Pros**: Simple to implement, reliable
**Cons**: High latency, resource inefficient, poor real-time performance
**Verdict**: Rejected due to latency requirements

### 3. Apache Kafka
**Pros**: Enterprise-grade messaging, excellent scaling, rich ecosystem
**Cons**: Operational complexity, resource overhead for our scale
**Verdict**: Rejected as over-engineered for current needs (revisit at scale)

### 4. Cloud-Native Messaging (AWS SQS/SNS, GCP Pub/Sub)
**Pros**: Managed service, built-in scaling, vendor integration
**Cons**: Vendor lock-in, higher costs, migration complexity
**Verdict**: Rejected to maintain cloud-agnostic approach

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Scalability**: Can handle increasing event volume by adding more processors
- **Resilience**: Failed events can be retried automatically
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add new event types and processors
- **Performance**: Non-blocking processing enables fast response times
- **Observability**: Built-in metrics and tracing for event flow

### Negative
- **Complexity**: More moving parts than synchronous approach
- **Eventual Consistency**: Some operations may have slight delays
- **Debugging**: Distributed systems are harder to debug
- **Resource Usage**: Additional infrastructure components required

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Complexity**: Comprehensive documentation and monitoring
- **Debugging**: Distributed tracing with correlation IDs
- **Testing**: Event-driven testing framework with synthetic events
- **Monitoring**: Detailed metrics on event processing latency and errors

## Implementation Details

### Technology Choices
- **Event Bus**: Redis Streams (lightweight, high performance)
- **Serialization**: JSON for human readability, Protocol Buffers for high-volume
- **Processing**: Python asyncio with concurrent workers
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics for event processing

### Event Processing Patterns
1. **Fan-out**: Single event triggers multiple processors
2. **Pipeline**: Sequential processing stages
3. **Competing Consumers**: Multiple workers process from same stream
4. **Dead Letter Queue**: Failed events for manual inspection

### Error Handling
- Exponential backoff for retries
- Circuit breaker pattern for external dependencies
- Poison message detection and quarantine
- Alerting for processing failures

### Scalability Considerations
- Horizontal scaling of event processors
- Redis cluster for high availability
- Consumer group balancing
- Resource-based auto-scaling

## Monitoring and Observability

### Key Metrics
- Event processing latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Event throughput (events/second)
- Error rates by event type and processor
- Queue depth and backlog size

### Alerting Thresholds
- Processing latency > 10 seconds
- Error rate > 5% over 5 minutes
- Queue depth > 1000 events
- Dead letter queue messages > 10

## Security Considerations

- Webhook signature verification for all platforms
- TLS encryption for all event communication
- Event data sanitization to remove sensitive information
- Access controls for event stream consumers

## Future Considerations

### Scaling Triggers
- When event volume exceeds 10,000/hour: Consider Kafka migration
- When latency requirements become <1 second: Consider in-memory solutions
- When cross-region deployment needed: Consider cloud-native messaging

### Evolution Path
1. **Phase 1**: Redis Streams implementation (current)
2. **Phase 2**: Add event schema registry for better versioning
3. **Phase 3**: Consider Kafka for enterprise scale
4. **Phase 4**: Event sourcing for complete audit trail
