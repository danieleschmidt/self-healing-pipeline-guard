# ADR-002: Python as Primary Development Language

## Status
**Accepted** - January 2025

## Context

The Self-Healing Pipeline Guard requires a programming language that can effectively handle:

- Machine learning model development and inference
- API integrations with multiple CI/CD platforms
- High-performance async processing of events
- Complex pattern matching and data analysis
- Rapid prototyping and development velocity

- **Monitoring**: Rich observability libraries (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry)

### Negative Impact

#### Performance Considerations
- **GIL Limitations**: Global Interpreter Lock for CPU-bound tasks
- **Memory Usage**: Higher memory footprint than compiled languages
- **Startup Time**: Slower cold start compared to compiled binaries
- **Type Safety**: Runtime type checking vs compile-time guarantees

#### Deployment Complexity

- **Multiprocessing**: Use process pools for CPU-intensive ML tasks
- **Caching**: Redis/memory caching for frequently accessed data

#### Deployment Solutions
- **Containerization**: Docker for consistent deployment environments
- **Dependency Locking**: Poetry/pip-tools for reproducible builds
- **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection in CI/CD
- **Monitoring**: Runtime performance monitoring and alerting

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
```python
# Type hints required for all public interfaces
async def analyze_failure(
    pipeline_id: str,
    logs: List[str],
    context: FailureContext
) -> AnalysisResult:
    """Analyze pipeline failure and suggest remediation."""
    pass

# Pydantic models for data validation
class PipelineEvent(BaseModel):
    id: UUID
    timestamp: datetime
    platform: PlatformType
    repository: str
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]
```

### Performance Requirements
- **API Response Time**: <200ms for 95% of requests
- **Event Processing**: <30s for failure analysis
- **Memory Usage**: <512MB per worker process
- **Concurrency**: Support 100+ concurrent event processors

### Security Practices
- **Input Validation**: Pydantic models for all external data
- **Secrets Management**: Environment variables with validation
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated security vulnerability detection
- **Code Analysis**: Static analysis with bandit and semgrep

## Monitoring and Metrics

- Event processing time (ML analysis)
- Memory usage per process
- CPU utilization patterns

### Code Quality Metrics

### Migration Strategy
If performance becomes a critical bottleneck:
1. **Profile and Optimize**: Identify specific bottlenecks
2. **Selective Rewrite**: Replace critical components with Go/Rust
3. **Microservices**: Language-specific services for specialized tasks
4. **Full Migration**: Last resort if Python cannot meet requirements
