## Incident Response Process

### Phase 1: Detection and Initial Response (0-15 minutes)

#### Automated Detection
1. **Alert Triggered**: Monitoring system detects issue
2. **PagerDuty Activation**: On-call engineer notified
3. **Slack Notification**: Team channel alerted
4. **Incident Created**: Automatic incident ticket generation

#### Manual Detection
1. **Issue Reported**: User or team member reports problem
2. **Initial Assessment**: Severity evaluation
3. **Incident Declaration**: Formal incident creation
4. **Team Notification**: Alert relevant team members

#### Initial Response Actions
```bash
# Immediate assessment commands
kubectl get pods -n healing-guard
kubectl logs -f deployment/healing-guard --tail=100
curl -s http://healing-guard.internal/health | jq .

# Check monitoring dashboards
# - Application health dashboard
# - Infrastructure metrics
# - Error rate trends
```

### Phase 2: Investigation and Diagnosis (15-60 minutes)

#### Incident Commander Actions
1. **Assemble Response Team**: Identify required expertise
2. **Establish Communication**: Set up war room/bridge
3. **Set Investigation Timeline**: Define checkpoints
4. **Begin Status Updates**: Regular communication cadence

#### Technical Investigation
1. **Gather Information**:
   ```bash
   # Check application logs
   kubectl logs deployment/healing-guard -n healing-guard --since=1h
   
   # Review metrics
   curl -s "http://prometheus:9090/api/v1/query?query=up{job='healing-guard'}"
   
   # Database health
   psql -h db-host -U healing_guard -c "SELECT 1"
   
   # External dependencies
   curl -s https://api.github.com/rate_limit
   ```

2. **Analyze Patterns**:
   - Error message analysis
   - Timeline correlation
   - Resource utilization
   - External dependencies

3. **Form Hypothesis**:
   - Root cause theories
   - Impact assessment
   - Fix strategies

#### Decision Points
- **Continue Investigation** vs **Implement Workaround**
- **Scale Response Team** vs **Maintain Current Team**
- **Communicate Externally** vs **Internal Only**

### Phase 3: Mitigation and Resolution (1-4 hours)

#### Immediate Mitigation
1. **Implement Workarounds**:
   ```bash
   # Scale up replicas
   kubectl scale deployment/healing-guard --replicas=10
   
   # Enable circuit breakers
   kubectl patch configmap/healing-guard-config -p '{"data":{"CIRCUIT_BREAKER_ENABLED":"true"}}'
   
   # Redirect traffic
   kubectl patch service/healing-guard -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"stable"}}}'
   ```

2. **Resource Allocation**:
   - Increase compute resources
   - Database scaling
   - CDN adjustments

#### Root Cause Resolution
1. **Code Fixes**:
   ```bash
   # Emergency hotfix deployment
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b hotfix/incident-response
   # Make necessary changes
   git commit -m "hotfix: resolve incident XYZ"
   git push origin hotfix/incident-response
   
   # Fast-track deployment
   kubectl set image deployment/healing-guard healing-guard=healing-guard:hotfix-v1.2.3
   kubectl rollout status deployment/healing-guard
   ```

2. **Configuration Updates**:
   ```bash
   # Update environment variables
   kubectl patch deployment/healing-guard -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"healing-guard","env":[{"name":"MAX_WORKERS","value":"20"}]}]}}}}'
   
   # Update ConfigMaps
   kubectl create configmap healing-guard-config --from-file=config/ --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
   ```

### Phase 4: Verification and Monitoring (30 minutes - 2 hours)

#### Health Verification
1. **Functional Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Health check verification
   curl -s http://healing-guard.internal/health | jq '.status'
   
   # End-to-end testing
   python scripts/integration_test.py --env=production
   
   # Load testing
   locust -f tests/performance/locustfile.py --host=https://healing-guard.prod --users=100 --spawn-rate=10 --run-time=10m --headless
   ```

2. **Metrics Validation**:
   - Error rates back to baseline
   - Response times normalized
   - Resource utilization stable
   - User-facing metrics recovered

#### Extended Monitoring
- **24-hour observation period** for SEV-1 incidents
- **Enhanced alerting** for related metrics
- **Rollback preparation** in case of regression
