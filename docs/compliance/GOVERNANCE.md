# Software Development Governance Framework

## Overview

This document establishes governance practices for the Self-Healing Pipeline Guard project, ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements.

## Compliance Frameworks

### SOC 2 Type II Alignment
- **Security**: Implemented through comprehensive security scanning and access controls
- **Availability**: Ensured via monitoring, alerting, and incident response procedures
- **Processing Integrity**: Maintained through automated testing and code review processes
- **Confidentiality**: Protected via secrets management and encryption standards
- **Privacy**: Addressed through data handling policies and access restrictions

### ISO 27001 Controls Implementation
- **A.12.6.1**: Management of technical vulnerabilities via automated security scanning
- **A.14.2.1**: Secure development policy through CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines
- **A.14.2.5**: Secure system engineering principles via architecture reviews
- **A.14.2.8**: System security testing through comprehensive test suites

## Code Review Requirements

### Mandatory Review Criteria
- All production code changes require minimum 2 reviewer approvals
- Security-sensitive changes require security team review
- Architecture changes require architecture review board approval
- Documentation updates require technical writing review

### Review Checklist
- [ ] Code follows established style guidelines
- [ ] Tests provide adequate coverage (>80%)
- [ ] Security implications assessed
- [ ] Performance impact evaluated
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately
- [ ] Breaking changes documented

## Release Management

### Release Approval Process
1. **Development**: Feature branch development with peer review
2. **Integration**: Automated testing in staging environment
3. **Security**: Security scan approval required
4. **Quality**: Quality gate passage mandatory
5. **Production**: Release manager approval for production deployment

### Rollback Procedures
- Automated rollback triggers for critical failures
- Manual rollback procedures documented in runbooks
- Database migration rollback strategies defined
- Monitoring-driven automatic rollback decisions

## Risk Management

### Technical Risk Assessment Matrix
| Risk Level | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| Critical | High | High | Immediate escalation, emergency response |
| High | Medium | High | Priority fix within 24 hours |
| Medium | Low | Medium | Fix in next sprint cycle |
| Low | Low | Low | Backlog item for future consideration |

### Security Risk Categories
- **Code Vulnerabilities**: Addressed via static analysis and dependency scanning
- **Infrastructure Risks**: Mitigated through IaC and security hardening
- **Access Control**: Managed via least-privilege principles and regular audits
- **Data Protection**: Ensured through encryption and secure data handling

## Audit and Compliance Reporting

### Automated Compliance Checks
```bash
# Weekly compliance report generation
npm run compliance:check
poetry run compliance-audit --format=json --output=audit-report.json
```

### Manual Audit Procedures
- Quarterly code review audit
- Annual security assessment
- Bi-annual compliance framework review
- Monthly access control verification

## Change Management

### Change Classification
- **Standard**: Pre-approved low-risk changes
- **Normal**: Requires change advisory board approval
- **Emergency**: Expedited process for critical fixes
- **Major**: Requires extended testing and stakeholder approval

### Change Documentation Requirements
- Business justification and impact assessment
- Technical implementation details
- Testing strategy and acceptance criteria
- Rollback plan and success metrics
- Post-implementation review schedule

## Training and Awareness

### Required Training Programs
- Secure coding practices (annual)
- Compliance framework updates (quarterly)
- Incident response procedures (bi-annual)
- Tool-specific training (as needed)

### Knowledge Management
- Architecture decision records (ADRs) maintenance
- Runbook creation and updates
- Best practices documentation
- Lessons learned capture and sharing

## Metrics and KPIs

### Governance Effectiveness Metrics
- Code review participation rate: >95%
- Security vulnerability resolution time: <48 hours
- Compliance audit success rate: >98%
- Change success rate: >95%

### Quality Indicators
