# Project Charter: Self-Healing Pipeline Guard

## Executive Summary

The Self-Healing Pipeline Guard is an AI-powered CI/CD guardian that automatically detects, diagnoses, and fixes pipeline failures, reducing mean-time-to-green by up to 65% through intelligent remediation strategies.

## Problem Statement

Modern software development teams lose 20-40% of their productivity to CI/CD pipeline failures, with developers spending hours debugging flaky tests, resource exhaustion, and dependency conflicts. Current solutions are reactive and require manual intervention, leading to:

- **High MTTR**: Average 45-minute resolution time for pipeline failures
- **Developer Frustration**: Context switching and debugging interrupts flow state
- **Cost Inefficiency**: Unnecessary cloud spending from failed pipeline reruns
- **Reliability Issues**: Pipeline instability reduces deployment confidence

## Solution Overview

An intelligent automation system that:
1. **Detects** failures in real-time across multiple CI/CD platforms
2. **Diagnoses** root causes using ML-powered pattern recognition
3. **Heals** issues automatically with proven remediation strategies
4. **Learns** from outcomes to improve future healing success rates

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- **Multi-Platform Integration**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, CircleCI
